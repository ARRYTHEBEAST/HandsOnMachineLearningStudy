# Chapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks
> just a footnote. I am again going to start my ML journey from today, there has been a large gap of almost a month now.

### Problems in Training a Deep Neural Network
1. Gradient growing smaller or larger
2. Not enough training data for a large network.
3. Training may be slow
4. Overfitting the training set 


### Vanishing/Exploding Gradient Problem
