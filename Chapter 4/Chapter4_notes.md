# Chapter 4: Training Models

Two ways of solving a problem:

1. CLosed Form solution: This directly computes the mdoel parameters that best fit the model to the training set. 

2. Using an 'Iterative Optimization' approach, called as 'Gradient Descent'.

Shit, the author has asked for the reader to go through linear algebra, partial derivatives. So refer to the notebook called.

## Linear Regression

In chapter 1 ther was a simple linear regression of life satisfaction:

life_satisfaction = theta0 + theta1 x GDP_per_capita
