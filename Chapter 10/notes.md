### Logical computation with Neurons

Artificial Neuron: has one or more binary inputs. The output s activated when more than an certain number of its inputs are active.


### The perceptron

It is one of the most simplest ANN architecture. This is based on a threshold logic unit(TLU) or linear threshold unit (LTU). The inputs and outputs are numbers insteead of binary inputs. The TLU computes a linear function of its imputs. Then it applies a step function to the result.
